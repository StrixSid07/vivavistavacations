        <p className="mb-4">
          Cookies remain unique to each browser, meaning if you access our
          website from multiple browsers or devices, the data is collected and
          stored separately. Viva Vista Vacations uses session cookies to track
          your booking process and retain information as you move through
          different stages. These cookies enable our search panel to remember
          details you have entered, making it easier for you to return and
          continue browsing without re-entering information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For instance, if you select a holiday but leave the website and return
          later, our cookies ensure your selected holiday is still available for
          review. Similarly, if you save deals in our online scrapbook, they
          will be waiting for you when you revisit.
